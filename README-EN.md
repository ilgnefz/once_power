[简体中文](README.md) | English

OncePower is a file and folder batch renaming utility with additional features of batch deleting empty folders and batch moving files, allowing users to do advanced matching without learning regular expressions.

The original intention of software development was to batch rename images, so the new version has updated a new feature specifically for image renaming —— **View Mode**.

Activate this function in the lower left corner

![03](doc/03-e.png)

After opening it, we can right-click in the File Explorer to view the menu for directly adding files to the software when selecting or not selecting a folder.

Due to the limitation of the Windows system that only one file path can be passed in at a time, this feature can only select folders when the program is not running.

![17](doc/17.gif)

If you want to use multiple file or folder paths, you can place the shortcut of this software in the "Launch to" folder.

![18](doc/18.gif)

Then select the file that needs to be passed in and right-click

![19](doc/19.gif)

In the running state of the software, multiple files can be directly added using the right-click menu without the need to use "send to" to add multiple files (when running, adding by right clicking will automatically select the append mode).

![20](doc/20.gif)

## Match length with negative input

When the matching length is negative, start truncating from the end of the file name

![16](doc/16.gif)

## Filter files by extension

![15](doc/15.gif)

## Generate operation log files in OPLOG format

The log files generated by renaming are located in the "logs" folder of the software. The log files generated from the **Organize** menu are also located here by default, unless a target folder is set.

## Upload CSV file renaming

*Note: Currently unable to recognize Korean, Tibetan, or other text in CSV files (can recognize Japanese)*

Click the button in the lower right corner to upload a CSV file (only the first two columns of the CSV file will be read), or a TXT file with “,” separating the old and new names, or an OPLOG log file generated by OncePower (which can be used to revert back to the original name).

![14](doc/14.gif)

## Added undo function

## View Mode

In view mode, you can directly view images for sorting. To enable view mode, simply switch to the bottom left corner (Switching to View Mode will automatically delete files other than images).

In view mode, long press the image to drag and sort it.

# Quick Start

For unfamiliar icon functions, a prompt can be displayed after hovering over the mouse for the first time. You can also view the following image introduction

![01](doc/01.png)

# Function Introduction

Add files or folders to the software, and you can choose multiple options to drag them directly or select them through the menu in the bottom left corner.

Double clicking on an item in the list will automatically fill in the matching box with the original name of that item.

![10](doc/10.gif)

**Append Mode**: Off by default, each time a new file is added it will clear the existing files.It will not be cleared when it is turned on.

**Add Folder**: Enable this option to drag a folder directly into the list. By default, dragging in a folder will add all files under the folder to the list.

The storage icon in the lower left corner allows you to save some of the user's configurations to the point where you don't need to reset them each time you open it (the contents of the input box are not saved).

#### Match length

Input a number is the matching length, input "**number + space + number**" to intercept the specified section

#### Named by Date

If Naming by Date is turned on, matches are modified to be dates. The default is to name in 8-digit format for the date of creation.

You can control the number of digits in the date by adding or subtracting digits, or by entering numbers directly.
